Policy Decomposition

1. CIA requirement:
	C:
		who to see
		mechanism to enforce confidentiality
		business requirements 
	I:
		who to alter
		mechanism to detect errors and enforce integrity
		business requirements
	A:
		available for authorized users
		denying for unauthorized users		

2. AAA requirements:
	Authentication:
		Identification: 
			record created -> shared secret between user and system
				mechanism used for identity
				management of identity

		Authentication: 
			user presenting the known shared secret
				methods of authentication management
				strength of authentication methods

		something you "know, have, are"

		comprehensive requirement: 
			level of security
			scale and management of users
			specific use

		both party to each other -> mutual authentication

	Authorization:
		subject-object-activity model
			subject: user
			object: software item (ie, some feature)
			activity: the desired action of the software
		
		Mandatory Access Model:
			security system controls access 
			owner or subjects cannot change
			OS decide what label attached to every object and subject

		DAC:
			owner of an object decide which other subjects may have Access
			Mandatory Access Model (MAC) vs Discretionary Access Model (DAC)

		RBAC:
			Role

		Rule-BAC:
			using access control list(ACL)
			rules in ACL

	Auditing:
		Risk-based auditing issue:
			inherent risk: associated with process inherent error rate, assuming no internal controls
			detection risk: audit not detect an issue
			control risk: controls not detect or not prevent material errors 
		
		Organizational characteristics:
			Roles and responsibilities
			Separation of duties
			training and qualifications
			change & control management

3. Internal & External requirements:
Internal:
	protect audit logs
	data loss prevention
	monitor internal system traffic
	monitor internal controls

External:
	compliance with external obligations
	external connections (API for instance) with security controls and authentications
	content filtering and proxies
