6.Trusted Computing
	Principles:
		security
		privacy
		interoperability
		portability of data
		controllability
		ease of use

	Ring Model: system-based method of protecting data and functionality from errors and malicious behaviors 
	ring-0: OS
		-1: I/O
		-2: Device Drivers
		-3: Applications

	Reference Monitor
		reference validation mechanism mediates the interaction of subjects, objects and operations
			- complete mediation
			- tamper-proof
			- small enough

	Protected Objects
		cannot be directly interacted with, instead, must be done with protected sub-system

	Trusted Computing Base
		combination of hardware and software components that are employed to ensure security

	Trusted Platform Model
		implementation of specifications detailing secure crypto-storage on a chip 

	Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Initiative
		security 
		privacy
		reliability
		business integrity

7. Acquisition
	commercial vs government off the shelf software: for purchase or for government use
	buy vs build
	outsourcing: offshore development to reduce costs
