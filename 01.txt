General Security Concepts

1.Concepts:
	CIA
	AAA
	Non-repudiation (no denying)

2.Fundamental system elements:
	SEC(SECurity) management:
		Session: communication are secured from unauthorized access, Transmission Control Protocol
		Exception -> fail-safe
		Configuration


3.Principles:
	Good enough
	Least privilege
	Separation of duties
	Layered Security, defense in depth
	Fail-safe -> exception management
	Economy of Mechanism (ASAP simple)
	Complete Mediation (never bypassed)
	Open Design:
		security design (e.g, algorithm) will be open
		security is not dependent upon the design
		security is dependent on other element (e.g. a key)
	Least Common & Leveraging Existing Component
		- Separate process info
		- Reuse, fewer new components such that less opportunity
	Ease of use for users
	Weakest link:
		bucket theory, additional resources and work
	Single point fail:
		- all points analyzed
		- but survive from single point

4.Security Model
	Access Control Model
		1) Bell-LaPadula, it is confidentiality model
			Simple Security Rule (no read up rule) 
			Star Property Rule (only write down rule) 
		2) Take-Grant Model
			directed graph
			not typically used, mostly for analyzing and presentation
		3) Access Control Matrix Model
			subject (user) by object (software component) matrix, actions as the value
			general-purpose model, no constraints
			hard to implement
		4) Role Based Access Control
		5) Rule Based Access Control, e.g. no access after work hours
		6) Mandatory Access Model (MAC) vs Discretionary Access Model (DAC)
			MAC
			- security system controls access while individual subjects cannot change
			- owner of an object cannot decide which other subjects may have Access
			DAC
			- owner of an object can decide
	
	MultipleLevel Security Model, e.g. top secret
	
	Integrity models, integrity is more/even important than confidentiality
		1) Biba Integrity model:
			low-water-mark: only write down (no write up)
			use lower security level on lower level objects
		2) Clark-Wilson Model:
			CDI 
				constrained data items, subject to integrity controls
			CDI includes:
				IVP (integrity verification process) 
				TP  (transformation process, change state of data from one valid to another)
			UDI 
				unconstrained data items
	
	Information Flow Models, notion of information flows
		1) Brewer-Nash Model (Chinese Wall), enforce confidentiality. commercial enterprise operations
			- technology
				prevent access to data from conflicting groups
			- people
				trained not to compromise
			- policy
				to ensure the technology and personnel
		2) Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
			- storage 
			- movement 
			- processing 
			of data
		3) Use Case Model
			- from functional perspective
			- how system process data, normal and abnormal
	
	Assurance Models
		assure the level of confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities 
			- at anytime during life-cycle
			- doesn't matter by design or by accident
		focus on preventive element, driven by management focus on system design and construction
		vs. sales driven focus
		including misuse and abuse case
			- structured set of arguments
			- as evidence to demonstrate specific security claims
	
	Operational Model of Security:
	|----------------+---------------------+------------------------+
	| prevention ->  | detection ->        | response               |
	|----------------+---------------------+------------------------+
	| access control | logs                | backup                 |
	| firewall       | intrusion detection | incident response team |
	| encryption     | honeypots           | computer forensics     |
	|----------------+---------------------+------------------------|
		Prevention -> Detection -> Response

5. Adversary type & group
	type:
		Script Kiddie
		Hacker (key enemy)
		Elite

	group:
		unstructured
		structured
		highly structured
		nation-state
