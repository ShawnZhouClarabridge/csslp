Risk Management

1. Definitions and Terminology
(1) General terms:
	risk: possibility of loss
	residual risk: risk that remains after control
	total risk:
	risk management: overall decision-making process 
		1) identifying threats and vulnerabilities with its impacts
		2) determining costs to mitigate 
		3) deciding what actions 
	risk assessment (no actions to mitigate, focus on impact): 
		1) analyzing to identify risks 
		2) mitigating actions to determine impact
	asset: resource and info to run business
	vulnerability: characteristics of an asset that can be used by threat
	attack: 
	impact: the loss
	threat: anything with potential to cause harm to asset
	mitigate: reduce
	control: detect -> prevent -> mitigate

(2) Q&Q
Qualitative risk assessment: 
	subjectively determining

Quantitative terms:

	quantitative risk assessment: being objective, 
	highly depends on historical data

	single loss expectancy (SLE): impact per occurrence of threat
	exposure factor: magnitude of loss of an asset, percentage of loss of an asset 
		SLE = asset value * exposure factor

	annualized rate of occurrence (ARO): frequency of an event expected to happen annually 
		ARO = number of events/number of years

	annualized loss expectancy (ALE): how much loss of an event to cost annually
		ALE = SLE * ARO

(3) Well-formed risk management statement: fig 2-1
		asset vs. threat             -> impact
		vulnerability vs. mitigation -> probability

2. Type of Risk
(1) Systematic vs Unsystematic
	meaning predictable or not

(2) Business vs Technology
Business Risk: 
	financial: treasury, revenue, contract, fraud
	regulatory: security, privacy, business operation regulations  
	business continuity: recovering from disaster
	technology: at decision and management level
Technology Risk:
	security & privacy: corresponding risk coming with technologies used to do implementation
	project management risk: software developed with project management, thus with corresponding risk
	change management risk: software is keep changing

(3) Risk Controls
Types of control actions:
	Administrative 
	Technical 
	Physical
For each action, type of controls:
	Preventive: to prevent attack, primary
	Detective: to detect and record attack, like logs
	Corrective: to correct, recover and reduce impact
	Compensating: to do its job when primary set failed, defense in depth
Control framework: 
	fig 2-2

3. Qualitative Risk Management
	- expert judgment and experience
	- quickly prioritize risk without exact quantification
	- impact of threat & probability to occur
	- info expressions could be: 
		qualitative matrix
		failure mode effects analysis: 1-10 for severity, probability and detectability

4. Quantitative Risk Management
(1) Annualized Loss Expectancy model
	single loss expectancy: 
		SLE = asset value * exposure factor
	annualized rate of occurrence:	
		ARO = number of events/number of years
	ALE:	
		ALE = SLE * ARO

(2)	Residual Risk Model
	a control applied, risk being reduced by some measurable amount

(3) Calculate !!!

5. Governance, Risk and Compliance
(1) regulations and compliance
	regulations, can be internal or external:
		- based on contract
		- based on policy or strategic initiatives
		- defined by organizations
		- regulations or laws
	compliance -> external requirement
	conformance -> internal requirement

(2) legal:
	intellectual property (IP)
	data breach:
		- personally identifiable information (PII)
			protect by encryption, to meet PCI DSS
		- protect data prior to loss, such as encryption

(3) standards

6. Risk Management models
general model:
	asset identification
	threat assessment
	impact analysis
	control design and evaluation
	residual risk management

software engineering institute (SEI) model:
	identify
	analyze
	plan
	track
	control
